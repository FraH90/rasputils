## Python packages from git
This script let us install a subfolder from a git repository (hosted on github, gitlab, etc) as a python module inside the /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages, which is the default directory in which python packages are installed in Raspberry Pi OS.
This folder is managed in a system wide way (it means you can't install script normally by using pip on the raspberry; instead you need to use apt install python3-packagexyz, where packagexyz is the name of the package you want to install).
With the script the aim is to let user install packages that aren't published on the apt repositories, but are instead published as git repository (like PyRTOS...).
By the way, it's not the entire git repository that it's copied in the destination folder, but only a subfolder of it (since usually git repositories of python modules also contain other stuff beside the module in which we're interested into).
The destination folder is a subfolder of /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages; you can copy directly the subfolder of your choice from the repository in/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (without any subfolder) by leaving the "destination" field in the json file empty.
